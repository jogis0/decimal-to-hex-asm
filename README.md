# decimal-to-hex-asm
This is a program that converts a decimal number (from 0 to 65535) in to a hexadecimal number.
This program uses the TASM x86 assembly language.
Intel 8086 / 8088 emulators (emu8086 and DOSBOX) were used to make this program.
I attached a .EXE file that is compiled and ready to use (you will need some sort of Intel 8086 / 8088 processor emulator to run it).

Note that this program does not convert negative numbers, it only converts positive 32-bit numbers.
